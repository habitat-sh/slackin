# Habitat Community Slack

Hello and welcome! This page will walk you through joining and using the Habitat
Community Slack team. If you have any questions about anything here, please

address you use with be visible to other Slack users, but can be any address

The Habitat community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from
all over the world and work together to make Habitat better. Community members
fulfill many roles, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other
members of the community.  By joining the Habitat Community Slack you are agreeing
to follow the [Habitat Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

the signup process. Once you finish the signup process you can use Slack via
their web application or [download a desktop or mobile client](https://slack.com/downloads).

### Slack Channels

By default
you will be added to the `#general` channel which is our general-purpose
discussion chat. Other more topic-specific channels are available in the
channels menu on the left.

### I Need Help With Slack!

You can check out Slack's [Help Center documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us)
for answers to many common problems. If you are already logged in to Slack, you
can ask for assistance in the `#general` channel.

### Slack-tiquette

As with IRC, Slack has some of its own customs and etiquette. Our community
Slack is a volunteer-run organization so it is possible that there may be no
one around to help at times. Feel free to re-ask later on when more people are
around, or wait for a community member to check the recent scrollback.

Slack offers two channel-wide broadcast aliases: `@channel` and `@here`. Use
these very sparingly. Remember that use of these can send push notifications to
a large number of users, who may be confused or frustrated if the message was
less critical than they originally thought.

### FAQ

* **What Is Slack?**
  * Slack is a real-time chat system similar to IRC or Jabber. Here you can find
Habitat community members to ask questions, learn more about Habitat, or socialize
with our awesome community.
* **Why Slack?**
  * Stagnation of the user experience for IRC combined with many improvements available from Slack prompted us to avoid launching the Habitat Community on IRC. As Chef planned to move to Slack, we decided to _start_ on slack.
* **Can I Use My Supermarket or Discourse Account?**
  * Unfortunately not at this time. For now your Slack account is independent of
the other Habitat or Chef community tools.
* **Where I Can Find Logs Of Slack Channels?**
  * You can find a permanent, searchable archive of our Slack channels at [SlackArchive](http://habitat-sh.slackarchive.io/general/).
You can also search the last ten thousand messages from within the Slack client. Be aware that archiving must be configured
for each channel by inviting the `@slack_archive_bot` account.
* **Where Else Can I Find Help With Habitat?**
  * We have a forum at [forums.habitat.sh](https://forums.habitat.sh/)
if you prefer a more asynchronous approach. If support isn't
available, you can reach Chef Software's support team at [support@chef.io](mailto:support@chef.io).
* **I Really Like IRC, What Do I Do?**
  * Slack does offer an [IRC gateway](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP),
though it has historically had some stability issues.
